Equipped with this, your programming background, and your Development Accelerator experience, you'll be ready for the job market. We guarantee it. If you're a first-timer, learn to code here.

JAVASCRIPT APPS
Get working with JavaScript on Day One
A Development Accelerator is intense. Consider it a full-time job for eight weeks, and learning starts on day one. You'll spend half the day in the classroom working with world-class instructors, getting specialized attention, and honing your software development skills—preparing you for a successful career in tech.

OUR PHILOSOPHY
Intensive team projects
In popular imagination, developers work isolated and alone: headphones on with energy drinks and potato chips close at hand. This might be true in some cases, but we believe in collaboration. We reserve half of the day for intensive team projects. You'll get the chance to work with other students in the center of Seattle's startup world. South Lake Union is electric. Just being here, with exposure to the best developers in the nation, sparks productivity and creativity.

A NORMAL DAY
What happens in a Development Accelerator?
Although every day will be a little different, you can expect consistency. Half of the day, Monday through Thursday, you'll be in class mastering the art of writing code and getting one-on-one attention from instructors and teaching assistants. During the rest of the day you'll work on team projects with other Code Fellows, learning collaboratively. On Fridays, guest speakers give lectures, which gives you the opportunity to learn from and network with the brightest in the industry.

APPLYING TO CODE FELLOWS
What's the application process like?
To ensure the class operates at a high level and that you are ready to get the most out of your Development Accelerator, we have a thorough application and interview process, with pre-work assigned once you're accepted. The material prepares you for the course and is due the first day of class, so submit your application early.
